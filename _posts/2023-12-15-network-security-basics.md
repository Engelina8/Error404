# Network Security Fundamentals

Your network is the highway that your data travels on. Let's make sure it's a secure one.

## What We Cover
- How data travels across networks
- Why public WiFi is dangerous
- Securing your home network
- VPNs: what they are and when to use them

## Quick Security Wins
1. **Change default router passwords**
2. **Use WPA3 encryption** (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn't available)
3. **Keep firmware updated**
4. **Use a VPN on public networks**

## Red Flags on Public WiFi
- Networks named "Free WiFi" or similar generic names
- No password required
- Asking for personal info to connect

## VPN Recommendations
- **For Privacy**: ProtonVPN, Mullvad
- **For Business**: ExpressVPN, NordLayer
- **Free Options**: ProtonVPN (limited), Windscribe

Remember: If it's too convenient, it might not be secure!
